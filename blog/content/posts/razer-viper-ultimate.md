TR; DR: Razer Viper Ultimate is currently not configurable on Linux but can be used.

I bought Razer Viper Ultimate.
It is the first time I bought an expensive mouse, but I really liked it!

## First impressions

I Felt the body was light and a very fast connection for a wireless mouse.

And the feel of the click bottom and sensor is very good.

But I feel the mouse wheel is heavy.

I'll leave Detailed review to others...

## Use on GNU/Linux

- Of course, wired and wireless connection works.

- Currently, Viper Ultimate Can't setting on Linux because it doesn't support the openrazer. You should prepare Windows for settings. But a [PR](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/pull/1034) corresponding to the viper ultimate is open on the repository. So it will be supported by openrazer in the future.

- Mouse and charging dock LED is doesn't works. LED setting is not stored in the mouse. So it will do the rainbow sequence.

- Key bindings and DPI set in Windows work on another operating system.

## Conclusion

Razer Viper Ultimate is recommended if you can pay a lot of money for the mouse.

Can be used on operating system other than Windows. But can't change settings.
